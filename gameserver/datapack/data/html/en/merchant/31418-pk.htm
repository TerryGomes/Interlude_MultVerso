You must be a terrible sinner...<br>
From the perspective of the history of the universe, our life is but a blink of an eye. One moment of impulse and rage can cause you to commit a sin. If you're by chance currently being pursued, the only help I can offer is to let you stay here for a while.<br>
May you be redeemed of your sins as soon as possible...
