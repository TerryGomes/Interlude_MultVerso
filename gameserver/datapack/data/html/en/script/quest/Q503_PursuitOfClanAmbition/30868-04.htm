<html><body>Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
It is impossible to guess how old these three women are. They typically show up, mumble some incomprehensible incantations and vanish. My father has become obsessed by their remarks. I'm not sure if these witches have been of any help to my family in the past. If it was up to me I wouldn't have anything to do with those blasphemous old women. Would you be willing to visit them on my behalf? It is said that the youngest of the three sisters, <font color="LEVEL">Cleo</font>, can be found east of the village. Cross the bridge and you will find her.
