Sir Athebaldt has said that your clan would be helpful to me in my research. Would you like to know more about my research? Very well, I'll tell you! Recently, I and my old friend Tajif Goldgedder have been working on the development of a new type of golem! If things go according to plan, I shall soon create an awesome monster that can break through any castle wall with one blow! Let's see if it works!<br>
