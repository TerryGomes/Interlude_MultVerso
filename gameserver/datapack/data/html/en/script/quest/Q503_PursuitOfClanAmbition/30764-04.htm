<html><body>Balthazar:<br>
Sir Athebaldt has informed me that your clan would be helpful in my research. Would you like to know what I'm researching? All right, I'll tell you! Recently an old friend, Tajif Goldgedder, brought me some curious materials from Cruma Tower. I'll skip the details, but we are currently researching siege golems strong enough to break through any castle wall with one blow. If this works, the face of war will change dramatically!<br>
