<html><body>Balthazar:<br>
As I said, I must have <font color="LEVEL">10 titan powerstones and 10 Nebulite Crystals</font>. The powerstones can be taken from the mechanical devices attached to the bodies of <font color="LEVEL">titan soldiers and border guards</font> that you kill. You must handle them carefully and bring back undamaged ones! The Nebulite Crystals can also be obtained from the Titans. They resemble brightly Shining Gemstones that shine brightly but with their own special luster.
