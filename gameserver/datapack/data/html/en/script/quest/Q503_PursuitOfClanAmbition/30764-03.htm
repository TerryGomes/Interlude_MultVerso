<html><body>Balthazar:<br>
You must bring me Titan's Powerstones. You will find them in the Titan Cave, south of Aden. The degenerate Titans that live there are curious creatures, ancestors of the glorious civilization of ancient Titans. They have grafted a mechanical device to their bodies. Don't be deceived by their odd appearance, they are still incredible beings with unparalleled strength. They can, however, be outwitted by a resourceful person such as yourself.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">After you kill the titan soldiers or border guards</font> you can get the <font color="LEVEL">powerstone</font> from the mechanical device that is fitted on their bodies. You must handle them carefully, as a broken one is of no use at all... Please bring a powerstone in good condition. We shall also need <font color="LEVEL">Nebulite Crystals</font>, used as fuel for the powerstones. They resemble gems but are recognizable by the special luster they emit. We must have <font color="LEVEL">ten each</font> of the powerstones and Nebulite Crystals. Please do your best.
