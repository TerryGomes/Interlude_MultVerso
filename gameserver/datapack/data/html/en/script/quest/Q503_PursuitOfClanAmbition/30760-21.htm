<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
I see from your face that Sir Rodemai has been talking about me... Please don't misunderstand my intentions. When King Rauhel was alive, I served him faithfully. I have been as truthful with you up to now as I thought I could be... I believe my country needs a strong ruler such as myself.<br>
Ah yes, the mighty Scepter of Judgment! Ha! That broken-down old relic is no real use to me, but the stupid commoners and soldiers believe in its power. With the scepter I can rally my troops and make our enemies tremble! Thereby, I will be invincible. And you? I must admit, I took advantage of your clan for this reason. But isn't it true that you also used me for your own purposes? You will certainly need my help in the future. There may come a day when we will face each other as enemies. But for now, what is it that you need the most?<br>
Look! I have it in my hand. The <font color="LEVEL">Proof of Aspiration</font>! We can each help ourselves by helping each other! A fair trade, no?<br>
