<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
The people of Giran are now being threatened by the Land Dragon Antharas. Word has quickly spread of the beast's awakening. The powers that be have deluded themselves with the idea that the dragon can be subdued by hired mercenaries. I expect to see drakes and wyrms pouring out of Dragon Valley at any moment. We cannot trust these incompetents to solve this crisis.<br>
I have begun an operation in Giran to deal with the dragon. It could be in vain, but it could also be the first step toward the solution of the problem. First, you must go to <font color="LEVEL">Giran Castle Town</font> and find a man named <font color="LEVEL">Martien</font> who is seeing to my business affairs. I trust him completely and so should you. He will tell you more details when you see him. I will pray for the gods' divine protection over you and your clan.
