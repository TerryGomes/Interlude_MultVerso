<html><body>Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Gustav Athebaldt told me about you. It's an honor to finally get to work with you. Actually my father Sir Kristof Rodemai often speaks of you. He says that you and your race have embarked on a great mission, and I should watch you carefully and learn. I wish to meet the lord of your clan as soon as possible.<br>
Generations ago my family agreed to work for the Athebaldt family. Now they have ordered us to recover the Scepter of Judgment, a relic of the ancient kingdom. It may actually be just a legend, we have been searching everywhere without success.<br>
