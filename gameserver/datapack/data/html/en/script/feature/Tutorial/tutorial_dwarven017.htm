Congratulations, you've reached level 5!<br>
New skills are now available to you. To learn more about them, speak with <font color="LEVEL">the blacksmith or warehouse keeper in the village</font>. Follow the arrow above your head to find the blacksmith.<br>
To learn a skill, you must have earned a certain number of <font color="LEVEL">skill points (SP)</font>. SP increases each time you kill monsters. <br>
Your SP information is available in the <font color="LEVEL">Character Information Window</font>. Click the <font color="FF0000">face-shaped icon</font> on the bottom-right of the screen or type ALT+T to access the Character Information Window.<br>
