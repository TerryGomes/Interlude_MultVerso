<center><font color="LEVEL">[Penalty for Dying]</font></center><br>When a character dies, the character's Exp will be lowered as a penalty for dying.
<br>However, up to level 4, characters will not receive any penalty for dying. Therefore, up to level 4, characters will not suffer any loss for dying.
<br>At level 5 and up you will receive a penalty for dying. Therefore, be careful so that you will not die by some error or mistake.<br>
