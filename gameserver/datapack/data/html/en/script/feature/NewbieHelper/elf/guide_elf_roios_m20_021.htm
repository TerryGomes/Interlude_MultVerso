Have you ever seen an item called a <font color="LEVEL">spiritshot</font> while hunting? Or have you ever wondered about what a spiritshot is while reading the detailed information about a weapon?<br>
A spiritshot is an item that increases your magic attack. Directions for usage are identical to soulshots. While soulshots increase physical damage, spiritshots increase magic attack powers.<br>
When using spiritshots, your spellcasting speed increases, as well as the damage and the success rate of debuff type magic. It is quite a useful item.<br>
You will be able to acquire spiritshot-using weapons when you reach level 15. Check the information when buying a weapon. If the spiritshot consumption is more than x1, it means that the weapon uses multiple spiritshots as indicated.<br>
