Look, until you refine your profession, there's nothing more for you to learn. There are no new skills that you can be taught until you take the next step on your prefessional path at level 20.<br>
I'll give you a piece of advice for when you take that step. If you decide to be a Knight, you can learn Shield Stun, which, well, lets you stun opponents with your shield, and Heavy Armor Mastery, which increases your defense when wearing heavy gear. If you become a Warrior, you'll learn War Cry, which instantly increases your attack power. If you decide to be a Rogue, you will learn Bleed, which continues to inflict damage long after your attack, or Bow Mastery, which increases attack power when using a bow.<br>
Do those sound good to you? Then hurry up and train hard to take that next step.<br>
