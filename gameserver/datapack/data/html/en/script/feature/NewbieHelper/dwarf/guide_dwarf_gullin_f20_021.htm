Of course, blunt weapons are always the favorites with us Dwarves, but if you prefer something with an edge, a <font color="LEVEL">long sword</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">dirk</font> would both be a good choice for someone of your level. Even if you haven't been particularly lucking in hunting, you should be able to earn enough for a dirk quickly.<br>
If you carry a bow, the Forest Bow may be too encumbering if it's just used to supplement hand-to-hand attacks. A <font color="LEVEL">Hunting Bow</font> is a better choice for occassional use.<br>
Regarding armor, <font color="LEVEL">Bone Breastplates and Bone Gaiters</font> along with a buckler, gloves, Leather Shoes and a Wooden Helmet make an effective ensemble when you're around Level 17. If you are diligent in watching the market between adventurers, you may be able to find even better gear for an equivalent price.<br>
