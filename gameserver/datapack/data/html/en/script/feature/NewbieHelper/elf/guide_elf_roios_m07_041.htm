You can not simply sit down for a few days and learn magic. You must build your magical skills continuously, through the use of SP. For example, by now you may have learned Wind Strike up to Level 2. When you have saved 260 SP, you may use them to raise your Wind Strike to Level 3.<br>
Like any other skill, spells may be upgraded. It is up to you to choose whether to become an expert in a few spells by concentrating your SP in raising their level, or to become a generalist who knows many spells at a lower level.<br>
