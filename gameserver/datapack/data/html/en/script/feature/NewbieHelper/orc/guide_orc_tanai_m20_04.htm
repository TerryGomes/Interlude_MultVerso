<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
We need to talk about how to apply your skills in battle. I'm going to explain about <font color="LEVEL">disrupting magic</font>. You may have already seen greystone golems give up on casting a spell when they take damage while casting. Well, it's not just stone golems who do that, it applies to every monster that uses magic.<br>
There's nothing more you can learn from the Seers here. You can learn your next spells, like <font color="LEVEL">Benumb or Icy Flame</font>, when you refine your profession at level 20, from the new Seers you'll meet in the village of Gludin or in Gludio, the town of Humans.<br>
Orc Shamans are among the most powerful of Mystics, wielding spells like <font color="LEVEL">Blaze Quake</font>, to burn all the foes around them, or <font color="LEVEL">Chant of Life</font>, to increase HP recovery for all members of their party. You have some amazing things to learn.<br>
