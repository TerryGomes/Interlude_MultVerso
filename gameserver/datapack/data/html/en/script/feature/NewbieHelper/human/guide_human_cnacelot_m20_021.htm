Have you ever heard of an item called a <font color="LEVEL">spiritshot</font> while you were hunting? Or have you ever wondered about what a spiritshot is while reading the detailed information about a weapon?<br>
A spiritshot is an item that increases your magic attack. Directions for usage are identical to soulshots. While soulshots increase physical damage, spiritshots increase magic attack powers.<br>
When using spiritshots, your spellcasting speed increases, as well as the damage and the success rate of debuff type magic. It is quite a useful item.<br>
You will be able to acquire spiritshot-using weapons when you reach level 15. Check for the instructions when you buy weapons. If the spiritshot consumption is more than x1, it means that the weapon uses as many spiritshots as indicated.<br>
