Hand-to-hand weapons, in the form of fortified gloves for striking, require both hands to use. They stand out for their speed, which is far better than held weapons. In other respects, such as accuracy and chance of critical damage -- both of which are low -- they resemble blunt weapons.<br>
Since they are two-handed weapons, they can't be used with a shield. But the power of <font color="LEVEL">iron fists</font> skill can more than make up for this deficiency. Anyway, real fighters don't need to hide behind a board -- they're not afraid to touch the enemy!<br>
