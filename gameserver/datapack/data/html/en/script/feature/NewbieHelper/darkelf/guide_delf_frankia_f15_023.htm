<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
It's time for you to learn about magic items. I'm sure that by now you've used lesser healing, but there's far more that you must know about if you plan to survive.<br>
It is time that you began to acquire <font color="LEVEL">accessories</font>. This is the general term for items that increase your magic defense. Soon you will face stone golems in combat, your first magical enemies. If you do not have a strong magic defense, their magic will overwhelm you. Therefore, it is necessary for you to build up your magic defense to prepare for your first meeting with stone golems or other magical foes.<br>
Also, you should seek to acquire the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>. This magic scroll instantly transports you to the nearest village. It can also save you travel time, if you're in a hurry . Remember that even with a scroll, it will still take some time to cast the spell. The scroll isn't cheap at your level, but once you've used it a few times, you'll begin to appreciate its value.<br>
