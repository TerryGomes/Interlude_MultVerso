I've told you this before, but I'll repeat myself now -- the choice of your next professional step is very important. The whole course of your future will be based on the path you choose. You can choose between being a <font color="LEVEL">Human Wizard</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">Cleric</font>. If you want to know more about these professions, you should ask <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Biotin</font> in the Temple of Einhasad.<br>
