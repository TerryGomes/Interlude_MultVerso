Take the equipment you have -- I hope it includes an Apprentice's Spellbook -- and travel south from the village to hunt <font color="LEVEL">Balor Orcs</font> or <font color="LEVEL">walking fungi</font> until you are ready for a better weapon.<br>When you reach Level 9 or 10 and upgrade your weapon, go farther south to the Marshlands or the area surrounding the School of Dark Arts. Try fighting <font color="LEVEL">marsh zombies</font> or <font color="LEVEL">skeleton hunters</font> there. Be cautious -- Balor Orcs are aggressive, and may attack you before you attack them.<br>
Before you begin hunting orcs, seek out Sentry Kayleen, and speak to Trader Minaless before you start hunting marsh zombies. The quests they give you are necessary preparation.<br>
