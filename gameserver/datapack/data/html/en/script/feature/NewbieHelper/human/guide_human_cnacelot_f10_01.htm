Now I believe you're ready to explore more of this island, if all you've done so far is adventure around the village. <font color="LEVEL">Explore the north and south sides of the island.</font><br>
Grand Master Roien will have some important quests for you when you reach level 9 or so, but we'll talk more about that later. You'll disappoint your masters if you fail to progress because you're too timid. Explore the island, learn new skills, and practice using them in the wilderness.<br>
I believe you will be up to the tasks that Roien sets for you. Have faith in yourself, my young friend!<br>
