Try hunting <font color="LEVEL">imps, ashen wolves or goblins</font> near the village. Your spells are your most powerful attacks, so look for monsters you can defeat with a single spell until you reach at least level 3.<br>After level 6, go southwest and challenge <font color="LEVEL">Balor Orcs or walking fungi</font>. An important rule of thumb at these levels is to <font color="LEVEL">hunt the strongest monster you can defeat with two Wind Strikes.</font> And never forget that Orcs are dangerous, because if one is imperiled, others will come to join the fight.<br>
