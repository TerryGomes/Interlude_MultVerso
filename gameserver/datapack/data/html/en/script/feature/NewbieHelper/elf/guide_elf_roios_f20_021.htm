If you have chosen to wield a one-handed sword, then by now you probably possess a <font color="LEVEL">long sword</font>. If luck has been with you, you may have acquired a <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Reflection</font>or a <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Watershadow</font>. Both are quite similer to a long sword, so either will suit your purposes.<br>
A <font color="LEVEL">Shining Knife</font> is an appropriate choice if you prefer to fight with daggers. For archers, the Forest Bow may be too encumbering if it's just used to supplement hand-to-hand attacks. A <font color="LEVEL">Hunting Bow</font> is a better choice for occasional use.<br>
Regarding armor, <font color="LEVEL">Bone Breastplates and Bone Gaiters</font> along with a buckler, gloves, Leather Shoes and a Wooden Helmet, make an effective ensemble when you're around level 17. If you are diligent in watching the market between adventurers, you may be able to find even better gear for an equivalent price.<br>
