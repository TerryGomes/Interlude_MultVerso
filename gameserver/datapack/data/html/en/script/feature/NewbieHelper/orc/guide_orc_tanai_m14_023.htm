<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
It's time for you to learn about magic items. I'm sure that by now you've used Lesser Healing Potions, but there's far more that you must know if you plan to succeed.<br>
It is time that you began to acquire <font color="LEVEL">accessories</font>. This is the general term for items that increase your magic defense. Soon you will face magic users in combat, like the greystone golems of the Frozen Waterfall. If you do not have a strong magic defense, you will find their magic most devastating.<br>
Also, you should seek to acquire a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>. This magic scroll instantly transports you to the nearest village. If your favorite hunting ground is far from the village, the scroll can save you all the travel time used in returning. Remember that even with a scroll, it will still take some time to cast the spell. The scroll isn't cheap at your level, but once you've used it a few times, you'll begin to appreciate its value.<br>
