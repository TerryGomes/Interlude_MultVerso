By now, you should be able to hunt anywhere in the forest. I imagine that giant spiders and dark horrors are your primary targets. You can find many of these in the deep southern regions of the forest. Remember what I told you -- if travel time is becoming a nuisance, teleport through the gatekeeper to the outpost kept by <font color="LEVEL">Tyra</font>.<br>
If you crave a more difficult challenge, enter the <font color="LEVEL">School of Dark Arts</font>, southwest of the forest. It was once a laboratory for the study of black magic, but it became infested with evil spirits, which haunt it to this day. It is a dangerous place, but you should be able to triumph if you hunt with a group.<br>
Also, the Neutral Zone is farther south. This is where Humans, Elves and Dark Elves all gather to hunt. The creatures here are much tougher than the ones in our forest but, again, it should be reasonably safe for those hunting in parties.<br>
