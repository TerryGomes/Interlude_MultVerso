If you are reasonably bold in your hunting, you will have around 300 SP at level 7. Talk to the Seers, and they will show you a list of the skills you can learn.<br>
Skills are divided into active skills and passive skills. <font color="LEVEL">Active skills</font>, including spells, must be intentionally used. <font color="LEVEL">Passive skills</font>, on the other hand, permanently increase your basic abilities.<br>
When you reach level 7, learn offensive active skills to begin with. Start with <font color="LEVEL">Life Drain</font>, which restores your HP while damaging your enemies. <font color="LEVEL">Soul Cry</font> is an active offensive skill that you've had since you began. You can turn it on or off whenever you want, but remember that it drains MP whenever it's on, so make sure you turn it off when you don't need it.<br>
