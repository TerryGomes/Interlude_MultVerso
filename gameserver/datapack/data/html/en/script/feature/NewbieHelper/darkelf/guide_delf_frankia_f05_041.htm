Speak to <font color="LEVEL">Master Harant</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Master Trudy</font>, and they will reveal the skills and spells you may learn.<br>
You must understand that skills are divided into active skills and passive skills. <font color="LEVEL">Active skills</font> must be selected each time they are used, while <font color="LEVEL">passive skills</font> provide a permanent increase to your basic abilities when they're obtained. As a Dark Fighter, you can acquire skills that increase your abilities.<br>
When you reach Level 5, learn offensive active skills. <font color="LEVEL">Power Strike, Mortal Blow, and Power Shot</font> are the first three offensive active skills you may learn. Power Strike may only be used with <font color="LEVEL">sword</font> type weapons, Mortal Blow with <font color="LEVEL">dagger</font> types, and Power Shot with <font color="LEVEL">bow</font> type weapons. Power Shot, in particular, can cause great damage, but consumes great amounts of MP, so use it wisely.<br>
Finally, if you have a few spare SP, then learning <font color="LEVEL">Aura Defense</font> may be a good idea. This skill increases your defense, and is especially useful at your current levels, when your equipment is still rather weak.<br>
