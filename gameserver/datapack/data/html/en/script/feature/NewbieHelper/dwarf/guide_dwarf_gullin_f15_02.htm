<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
A broadsword or a mace will do for you until level 12, but after that you'll be needing more attack power.<br>
You can buy weapons in stores, of course, but it is usually more economical to trade with other adventurers. They're willing to sell items for less, and purchase your items for more than a merchant would offer. We Dwarves are traders by nature, so pay attention.<br>
On the bottom left of the Chat window, click on the <font color="LEVEL">Trade</font> tab. You'll probably find the window it opens full of messages from many other adventurers seeking to buy and sell goods. Chat with these adventurers if you want to make a deal. A good sense for dealmaking is an important survival skill.<br>
You should also get to know <font color="LEVEL">Private Store</font> on the Action tab. The Private Store has Buy and Sell options.<br>
For the <font color="LEVEL">Sell</font> option, execute the Sell action, then select the item you wish to sell. Set its price and enter a message, then press Start. It sells itself automatically, which comes in very handy.<br>
And for the <font color="LEVEL">Buy</font> option, execute the Buy action, then select the item you wish to buy, its price, and quantity, then press Start. But if you do not currently possess the item you wish to buy, you will not be able to purchase that item. Dwarves may register up to 5 different items on the Buy list, while other races may register up to 4 items.<br>
