Have you completed your mission for <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Thifiell</font> yet? It is very important that you complete this task.<br>
You should also see <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Karrod</font>. I suspect he has troubles that need to be dealt with. I'm sure that if you aid him, he'll be most generous.<br>
Look up <font color="LEVEL">Trader Minaless</font> as well. She is looking for a supply of zombie dust, and by dealing with her you can increase your profit from hunting marsh zombies.<br>
