By level 16, if you have been fortunate you may have acquired an <font color="LEVEL">apprentice's staff</font>. Even if luck has eluded you so far, you should have enough money to purchase one by level 18.<br>
If you are wearing <font color="LEVEL">Stockings of Devotion and a Tunic of Devotion</font> at level 17, you are in excellent shape. Remember to regularly check the goods that other adventurers are offering -- this is the best way to get a bargain price on a desirable item.<br>
There isn't much left to teach you about items, so listen carefully to what I have to say.<br>
