For now, you should keep hunting the Spine Mines. If you've only hunted around the village so far, now's a good time to <font color="LEVEL">explore the east side of the mountains</font>.<br>
Keep in mind, that at Level 10 you'll learn a skill that allows you to collect raw materials from monsters. If you ever want to be a Scavenger -- which is one of your two career choices -- this skill is crucial. Keep that in mind.<br>
The Guilds expect great things of you, and I know you don't want to return home a failure -- so, for the sake of your future success, work hard now!<br>
I know there's a great Artisan or a Scavenger within you, so keep the faith, eh!<br>
