<font color="LEVEL">Two-handed swords and two-handed blunt weapons</font> tell the world that a warrior possesses formidable power. It stands to reason that wielding your weapon with both arms would deal more powerful strokes, and also extend the weapon's reach. The drawback is that their attack speed is quite slow.<br>
They are a good choice for those who rely on devastating damage in combat. They are quite expensive however, so you will probably need to increase in experience and wealth before you can acquire one. Of course, the differences between one-handed swords and one-handed blunt weapons also apply to the two-handed varieties.<br>
