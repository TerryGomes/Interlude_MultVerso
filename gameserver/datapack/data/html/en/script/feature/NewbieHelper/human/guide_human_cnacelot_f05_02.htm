I suppose you're using the weapons and armor you were issued. That's unless you have rich friends, of course, eh?<br>
Whatever you have is fine for now. Remember to pay attention to what you find while hunting monsters -- you can find armor, and sometimes even weapons, in the wild. If you're lucky, you might find <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Shoes</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Cap</font>.<br>
You should have been given two weapons, a dagger and a Squire's Sword. Perhaps you have already noticed that daggers and swords perform differently in battle. The <font color="LEVEL">dagger</font> is swift, but its accuracy suffers, while the <font color="LEVEL">Squire's Sword</font> is noticeably slower than the dagger, but strikes with greater accuracy. Remember that different weapons may call upon different skills in their use. Either is a worthy weapon; it is up to you to decide which suits you best.<br>
Come back when you have reached <font color="LEVEL">level 6</font> and we'll talk more about weapons.<br>
