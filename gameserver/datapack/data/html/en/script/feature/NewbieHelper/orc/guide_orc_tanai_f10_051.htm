<font color="LEVEL">Prefect Brukurse</font>, one of your Masters, seeks to capture those treacherous maraku werewolves who killed the messenger of Flame Lord Kakai. Maraku werewolves are quite strong, so don't attempt this mission until you reach level 10. You can find maraku werewolves by leaving town on the south road and bearing southeast.<br>
If you want more quests, travel around and find them on your own. Make sure to talk to the Chiefs in the House of the King.<br>
