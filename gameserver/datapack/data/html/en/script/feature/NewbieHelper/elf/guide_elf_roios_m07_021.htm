<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
Listen closely, this is very important knowledge for an Elven Mystic like yourself. Armor is classified into robes, light armor and heavy armor. Mystics may wear armor of any type, but different types of armor will affect your abilities differently.<br>
When I refer to an armor set, I mean that the upper and lower body armor is of the same type. <font color="LEVEL">Robes provide little protection, but when worn by Mystics they increase casting and movement speed, and even increase MP.</font> With light or heavy armor, defense is increased, but casting speed, movement and MP are all lower than they would be with robes.<br>
These modifiers apply only to upper and lower body armor ... helmets, gloves and other protective items do not affect defense, casting speed, movement or MP. With such items, feel free to use the strongest you can find.<br>
