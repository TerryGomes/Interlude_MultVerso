<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
You must journey to the Kingdom of Aden to assume your new profession. You can obtain training in <font color="LEVEL">Gludin or Gludio Castle Town</font>. There is no more for you to learn here, in the land of your birth. Ask <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Thifiell</font>, at the Temple of Shilen, for further instruction.<br>
There are two ways to reach Gludio. If you travel by foot it will take some time, but cost no money. Or, if you wish, the gatekeeper can teleport you there. A fee is required, but it will save you the journey.<br>
