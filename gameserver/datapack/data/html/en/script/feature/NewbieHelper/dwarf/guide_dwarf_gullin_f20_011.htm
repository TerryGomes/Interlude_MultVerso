<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
A Dwarven Fighter like yourself might choose to become an <font color="LEVEL">Artisan</font>, or maybe you'll be a <font color="LEVEL">Scavenger</font>. Either way, it's time for you to leave the mines and head out to Aden.<br>
I advise you to go talk to a Grand Master to find out more. He'll examine your qualifications and give you advice on picking your occupation. You can go talk to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Reed</font> at the warehouse, or <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Bronk</font> at the blacksmith, whichever you'd prefer.<br>
