You will be regarded as mighty indeed if you can hunt the crimson spiders in the southern forest, or <font color="LEVEL">pincer spiders</font> in the northern regions. Spiders are aggressive, and that makes them dangerous, but I am sure you can find a way to defeat them. And if you assemble a party with another adventurer or two, you should be able to easily defeat the undead creatures that haunt the ancient Elven Fortress southwest of the village.<br>
