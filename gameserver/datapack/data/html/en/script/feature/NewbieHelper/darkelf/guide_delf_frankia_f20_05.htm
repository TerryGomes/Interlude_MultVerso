Seek out <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Thallos</font> as soon as you can. He is trying to free Hierarch Mitraell, but it has come to my attention that he does not yet possess all the necessary materials. I'm sure he'll reward you for your assistance.<br>
If you're already hunting giant spiders, then you should certainly speak to <font color="LEVEL">Astaron</font>. I have heard he is in need of giant spider's venom for some project.<br>
