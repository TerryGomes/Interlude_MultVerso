I'll teach you all I can, but I don't know everything. You need to speak to all the villagers you can, and hear what they have to tell you.<br>
You can start with a visit to <font color="LEVEL">Maryse Redbonnet</font>, who live near the north gate of the village. That girl's very upset about something, so maybe you can help her out.<br>
Also, near the south gate, <font color="LEVEL">Elder Spiron</font> of the Golden Wheel Guild is trying to deal with some trouble over the new trade road.<br>
