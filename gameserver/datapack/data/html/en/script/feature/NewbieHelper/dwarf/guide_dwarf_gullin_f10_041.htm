<font color="LEVEL">Create Item</font> is a passive skill that lets you <font color="LEVEL">produce items</font> -- it's the key skill that all others follow, if you choose the Warsmith's path. The power of the item you create depends on your level of skill with Create Item.<br>
Producing an item starts with a <font color="LEVEL">recipe</font>. That's just what it sounds like -- instructions for making an item. Great craftsmen hide their recipes inside strong monsters, so only the strongest can carry on their techniques. The stronger the monsters you defeat, the better the recipes you get, and the better items you can create.<br>
A recipe will tell you the Create Item skill level and any materials or tools you need for the item, plus instructions for putting it all together. For simple items you just need to collect the materials, but complex ones -- ah, there's a great deal more to be done.<br>
For now, just go looking for recipes on the monsters you hunt. You'll understand what I'm saying better when you see the real thing.<br>
