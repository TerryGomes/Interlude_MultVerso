It is time to discuss forming a <font color="LEVEL">party</font>, a group of adventurers to hunt and travel with. Parties are created using <font color="LEVEL">Invite</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Action</font> tab (<font color="LEVEL">ALT + C</font>) of your Character Status window. First, click on the person you wish to invite into your party, then click the Invite icon. When you next enter the hunting grounds, I recommend you attempt to form a party with another adventurer there.<br>
If you are having difficulty finding party members, use the <font color="LEVEL">Party Matching</font> button in the Action tab of your Character Status window. This will display a useful list of adventurers who also wish to form parties. You may use Invite, Whisper or other useful commands from this window.<br>
This is the point in your career where you learn whether you are a "tiger" who likes to hunt alone, or a "lion" who prefers the company of a group. If you're a tiger, you will need to perfect strategies for ensuring your own survival, whereas a lion must learn how how best to serve the interests of the group.<br>
