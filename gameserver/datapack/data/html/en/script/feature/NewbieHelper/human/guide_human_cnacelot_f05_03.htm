Begin by hunting <font color="LEVEL">keltirs</font>, <font color="LEVEL">elder keltirs</font> or <font color="LEVEL">wolves</font> near the village. The wolves are the more dangerous, so take care.<br>
When you target a monster, the monster's name appears in the upper central portion of the screen. <font color="LEVEL">The color of the name tells you the monster's difficulty</font>. For now, hunt those that appear in white or sky blue. Those that appear in red or yellow are much stronger than you, so leave them alone.<br>
And I warn you, don't try to tangle with the orcs yet. Orcs are smarter and stronger than you think, but the most dangerous thing is that they know about teamwork -- if you attack one, several others may come to its aid. Even if you might have a chance against a single orc, you won't be able to stand against two or three.<br>
