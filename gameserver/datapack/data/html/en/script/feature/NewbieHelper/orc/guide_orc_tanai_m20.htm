<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
I'm surprised by your progress. There's little left for me to teach you. It's time for you to end your training and begin your adventures outside the kingdom. First you'll have to take the next step on your professional path at the Human village of Gludin. The future of the Orcish race may depend on your strength -- may you earn the power to bend the world to your will.<br>
