Travel southeast of the village and hunt <font color="LEVEL">Kaboo Orcs</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Kaboo Orc grunts</font>. Orcs are difficult to hunt, for they understand teamwork. In particular, beware the <font color="LEVEL">Kaboo Orc grunts</font>, for they will attack you even before you attack them, unlike other monsters.<br>
If you are past level 6, you may undertake the quest to "Hunt the Orcs" from <font color="LEVEL">Sentinel Rayen</font>, which you should complete before you begin hunting farther afield for yourself.<br>
You will find that the amulets and necklaces dropped by the orcs you slay will become a useful source of adena.<br>
