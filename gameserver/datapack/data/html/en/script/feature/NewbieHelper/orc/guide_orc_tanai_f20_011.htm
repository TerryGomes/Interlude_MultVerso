A Fighter like you can choose to become an <font color="LEVEL">Orc Raider</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">Monk</font>. But the Prefects who can help you choose the next step on your professional path have spread throughout the world, to Gludin and other regions, to preach the power of the Orcs.<br>
It's time for you to speak to Flame Lord Kakai for more details. He will examine your qualifications and give you information about choosing your profession. Go to the second floor of the House of the King, where you've been going to learn your skills, and meet <font color="LEVEL">Lord Kakai</font> for further information.<br>
