Powerful Orcish Prefects are spreading our power to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font>, the town of Humans. They've been sent because Fighters must train in the wide world. Ask <font color="LEVEL">Flame Lord Kakai</font> if you want to know more. He's on the second floor of the House of the King, the large building in the center of the city.<br>
Once you could get to Gludin on foot or by boat, but since the war between Elmore and Aden, the teleport gate is the only way to get there. Ask <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Tamil</font> in the square. You can either pay adena for your passage, or complete some service that Tamil will ask of you.<br>
