Mystics of our race can choose from a wide selection of spells. In fact, it can be a bit confusing at first, but soon you learn to enjoy all the variety.<br>
I can give you a few tips. Learn <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Dream</font> before you reach level 14. It will make it much easier to survive and improve your hunting. Next, learn <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font>.<br>
Be very careful when it comes to passive skills related to armor. Think about the armor you're wearing right now, and whether you plan to concentrate on physical or magical defenses. If you learn Robe Mastery, it will help you learn magic quickly, but your defenses will decrease. If you learn Light Armor Mastery, your defenses will increase, but your MP and magical speed will decrease.<br>
When you get your level 14 skills, if you prefer physical attacks, increase <font color="LEVEL">Soul Cry to level 2</font>. If you depend on magic, learn <font color="LEVEL">Battle Chant</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Fear</font>, and hunt with a party.<br>
If you hunt alone, indirect attack magic, such as <font color="LEVEL">Icy Flame</font>, is useful.<br>
