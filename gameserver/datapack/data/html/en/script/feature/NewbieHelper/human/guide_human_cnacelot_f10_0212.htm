<font color="LEVEL">One-handed blunt weapons</font> have a higher accuracy than other weapons. However, their chance to inflict critical damage is much lower. Blunt weapons are designed to reliably deal predictable amounts of damage. I recommend these weapons to Mystics, who do not have the training to be highly accurate in combat, or to any warrior who values consistency in battle.<br>
As you advance, you can acquire skills specifically for blunt weapons. Something to keep in mind about blunt weapons is that they have greater damage range than other weapon types. For example, a blunt weapon with an average attack power of 10 would have a damage range of 7 to 13, whereas a sword with the same average power would have a range of 9 to 11.<br>
