<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
You must refine your profession at level 20. If you do not, there is nothing more that you can be taught here. Only after you select your professional path can you go on to learn new skills.<br>
If you choose to become a Palus Knight, for example, you can learn skills such as Defense Aurora, which increases your defense for a set period of time. Or if you become an Assassin, you can learn Long Range Shot, which increases the range of your bow shots.<br>
Does the promise of such knowledge tempt you? Hurry then, and continue to train until you're ready to choose.<br>
