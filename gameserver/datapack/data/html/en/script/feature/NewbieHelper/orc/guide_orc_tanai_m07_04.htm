When you reach level 7, you will learn new magic. Seek instruction from the Seers of the Mystics Guild. That's the room on your right as you enter the House of the King, the largest building in the village, there in the center of town.<br>
You have probably noticed by now that when you defeat monsters you gain both <font color="LEVEL">SP</font> and experience. SP means "skill points," and they are deducted whenever you learn new skills or magic. You can check your current SP by clicking on your <font color="LEVEL">Character Status</font> button, then on the <font color="LEVEL">Status</font> tab.<br>
