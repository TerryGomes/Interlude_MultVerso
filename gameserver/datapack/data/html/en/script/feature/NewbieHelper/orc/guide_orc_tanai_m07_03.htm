For now, go out and hunt <font color="LEVEL">crimson keltirs</font>, <font color="LEVEL">elder crimson keltirs</font> or <font color="LEVEL">kasha wolves</font>, northwest of the village. Wolves are the most dangerous, so watch out. Leave the village by the north or south gate and climb down the hill. You can't miss them.<br>
And I warn you, don't try to tangle with goblins at levels 3 to 4. Goblins are smarter and stronger than you might think, but the most dangerous thing is that they know about teamwork -- if you attack one, several others may come to its aid. Even if you might have a chance against a single goblin, you won't be able to stand against two or three. Steer completely clear of goblins until you reach level 6 or higher.<br>
