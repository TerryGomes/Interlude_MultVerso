From the looks of you, I'd say you're ready for <font color="LEVEL">black timber wolves, Utuku Orcs and Utuku Orc grunts</font>. You may need to hunt goblins as well, to complete some quests.<br>
If you need good hunting grounds, head straight north from the north gate, and follow the river to the estuary. You'll find plenty of orcs there to make you feel welcome.<br>
