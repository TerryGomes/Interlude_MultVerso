<font color="LEVEL">Trader Herbiel</font>, at the store on the west side of town, is collecting pouches of spores for research purposes. By all means speak to him.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Sentinel Kendell</font> at the southeast gate is again recruiting warriors to battle against the orc tribes that came to our lands from over the Misty Mountains. This time, the plan is to subdue the chief commanders of the orcs.<br>
