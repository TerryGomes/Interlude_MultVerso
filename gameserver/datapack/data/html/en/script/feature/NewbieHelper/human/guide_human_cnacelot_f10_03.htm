I think you'll do well to hunt <font color="LEVEL">orcs, werewolves, and goblins</font>.<br>
First, to find orcs, just follow the seashore from your former hunting grounds, and head northwest. Or exit the village by the northern gate and travel west to the circle of standing stones we call the Elven Ruins. Before you begin hunting orcs, however, you should speak to Captain Gilbert on the east side of the village. He rewards those who bring him proof of orcs slain. Doesn't it make sense to get as much profit as you can from your hunting endeavors?<br>
Travel north from the village and bear a little to the left. There is a tower there called <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory</font> that the Elves built. It marks a good hunting ground if you're around level 8 or so -- plenty of orcs and werewolves tend to frequent the area.<br>
