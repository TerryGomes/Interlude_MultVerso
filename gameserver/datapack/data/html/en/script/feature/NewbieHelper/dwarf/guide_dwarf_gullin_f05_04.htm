When you reach Level 5 you'll start studying your skills. Skills are taught at the Iron Gate Guild -- the <font color="LEVEL">warehouse</font>, as they call it -- by the east gate, or the Black Anvil Guild -- it looks like a <font color="LEVEL">blacksmith's shop</font> if you look east from the square at the north gate. Now, this is important; you'll need <font color="LEVEL">SP</font> to gain your skills. SP is short for <font color="LEVEL">skill points</font>, and they're earned along with experience whenever you defeat a monster. SP are deducted whenever you learn a new skill. You can check your SP by clicking the <font color="LEVEL">Character Status</font> button, then on the <font color="LEVEL">Status</font> tab in the window. Of course, the number of SP you need will vary, depending on the skill you're after.<br>
