I think you're ready for <font color="LEVEL">kasha wolves, kasha timber wolves, goblin grave robbers and rakeclaw imps</font>.<br>
Go down the end of the northern road, then take the southwestern road from the fork to find the kasha timber wolves. If you take the southern road from the village, you might also find similar prey near where that road forks. Actually, why don't you try the south first, if it's not too crowded there.<br>
If you follow the northeastern road, or walk southwest from the end of the southern road, you will find goblins. Follow the road to the east for imps. At level 6 you should be able to deal with ordinary imps, but avoid their leaders until level 9 or so.<br>
