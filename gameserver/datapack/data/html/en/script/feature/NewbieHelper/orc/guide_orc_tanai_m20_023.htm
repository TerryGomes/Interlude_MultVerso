You may have heard of a <font color="LEVEL">spiritshot</font> while you were hunting or possibly read a detailed description of it.<br>
A spiritshot increases your magic attack. Its usage is identical to soulshots. While soulshots increase damage inflicted by physical attack, spiritshots increase the strength of magic attacks.<br>
When using spiritshots, your spellcasting speed increases, as well as the damage and the success rate of debuff type magic. It can prove to be a very useful item.<br>
You may acquire spiritshot-using weapons when you reach level 15. Check for the instructions when you buy weapons. If the spiritshot consumption is more than x1, that weapon uses the number of spiritshots indicated.<br>
