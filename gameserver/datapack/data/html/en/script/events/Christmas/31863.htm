Ho! Ho! Ho! This is the season to decorate our village with pretty Christmas Trees, don't you agree? Two types of trees are available: regular and special. <br>
<font color="LEVEL">To make a Regular Christmas Tree:</font><br1>
Collect 4 Star Ornaments, 4 Bead Ornaments, 10 Fir Tree Branches, and 1 Flower Pot. Collect all of these ingredients and bring them to me. I'll make you a marvelous Christmas Tree! These ingredients can be obtained by killing the evil spirits that lurk outside the village!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">To make a Special Christmas Tree:</font><br1>
Collect 10 regular type Christmas Trees and bring them to me. I will make you a very Special Christmas Tree! This tree has the ability to restore the HP and MP of those who come near it. <br>
