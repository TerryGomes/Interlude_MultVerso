Greetings! Your reputation precedes you. Your clan is quite powerful, eh? And you are headed to Dragon Valley...? I've got a favor to ask you. Could you possibly try to find my younger brother? He is a bounty hunter who has fallen in with a bad crowd known as the <font color="LEVEL">Magpie Brothers</font>. It is said that they are searching for something in Dragon Valley at the behest of some Human royalty... Something is not right about this...
