Speak to the <font color="LEVEL">Pa'agrio Priests </font> of the Temple of Pa'agrio. They will explain the basics of combat through quests.<br>
You must visit them, for they will give you a useful gift after you complete a quest.<br>
They are marked in yellow on the radar, at the upper-right corner of the screen. You must visit them if you wish to advance.<br>
