So have you used <font color="LEVEL">Spoil</font>, or <font color="LEVEL">Search</font> yet? The Spoil skill changes a monster's body so it can produce useful materials, and Search draws those materials out after the monster is dead.<br>
Taken together, these skills allow us Dwarves to collect materials that the other races can't have, and that's something we dearly love.<br>
