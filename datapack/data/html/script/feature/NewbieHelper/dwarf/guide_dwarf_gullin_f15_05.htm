Let's see now ... what quests should you be taking on? You're a good deal stronger than you were -- we don't want to waste your time on tasks that are too easy.<br>
I believe <font color="LEVEL">Collector Gouph</font> of the Bronze Key Guild is worried, because he's waiting for a delivery that hasn't arrived yet.<br>
Also, drop in on the Council of the Elders, and find out what you can about the giants' skills and airships and whatnot that <font color="LEVEL">Elder Arin</font> has been babbling on about lately. He's with the other council members near the south gate.<br>
