At your current level, a <font color="LEVEL">Wooden Breastplate</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">Hard Leather Pants set</font> are an effective combination. Leather Shoes, a Wooden Helmet and gloves will complete your set nicely.<br>
Of course, you won't be able to equip all this equipment immediately at Level 11, but you can start collecting them piece by piece, so they'll be ready to equip when you reach Level 15. It might also be a wise investment to start saving to purchase a Bone Breastplate at Level 14 or 15.<br>
