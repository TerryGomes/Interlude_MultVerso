Listen carefully -- there are two important tasks that you must soon complete. Seek out <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Thifiell</font> when you reach Level 10. He has an important quest to give you.<br>
Also, you must find <font color="LEVEL">Sentry Kayleen</font> in the southern reaches. She is recruiting volunteers for an Orc Subjugation quest, which you must complete before you can hunt Orcs.<br>
