The time has come to teach you specific tactical applications for your skills.<br>
First, you must understand the technique for <font color="LEVEL">canceling magic</font>. When you hunt marsh zombies, for example, you will notice that they sometimes give up on a spell they are casting when they take damage. This is true not just for marsh zombies, but for all magic-using monsters -- the more damage you inflict on a spell caster, the greater the chance that you will interrupt its spells. If mastered, this tactic can be used to defeat very strong enemies who rely on spells as their primary means of attack.<br>
