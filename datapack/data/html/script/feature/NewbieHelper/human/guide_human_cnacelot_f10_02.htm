At level 6, your most important task is to find better weapons. Consider the weapon you are wielding now, then think how you wish to improve it.<br>
If a dagger is your choice, seek to obtain a <font color="LEVEL">Bone Dagger</font>. A Doom Dagger is even better, but will be quite expensive. A Bone Dagger will do. If you prefer the sword, buy a <font color="LEVEL">small sword</font>, or a broadsword if you have the adena to spend. If blunt weapons suit you, you'll do fine with a <font color="LEVEL">club</font>. Blunt weapons have a high accuracy, and those who use them may learn stun skills.<br>
Whatever you choose for close combat, try to get a bow as well, if you can. Bows allow you to draw monsters to you by attacking them from a distance. And only those who have used Power Shot in combat can truly appreciate its formidable power in battle. Of course, Power Shot also consumes a formidable amount of MP when used, so take care.<br>Around level 9 or 10 you should have enough money to purchase better weapons, but you should speak to Grand Master Roien about weapons before you buy any.<br>
