You can begin to learn skills when you reach level 5. You will receive instruction in new skills from the Masters of the Warriors Guild. The guildhall lies to the east, near the tower at the crossroads in the center of the village.<br>
Now, pay attention; you'll need <font color="LEVEL">SP</font> to gain your skills. SP is short for <font color="LEVEL">skill points</font>, and they're earned along with experience whenever you defeat a monster. SP are deducted whenever you learn a new skill. You can check your SP by clicking the <font color="LEVEL">Character Status</font> button, then on the <font color="LEVEL">Status</font> tab in the window. Of course, the number of SP you need will vary, depending on the skill you're after.<br>
