<font color="LEVEL">Prefect Brukurse</font>, one of your mentors, seeks to capture those treacherous maraku werewolves who killed the messenger of Flame Lord Kakai. Maraku werewolves are quite strong, so don't attempt this mission until you pass level 10. You can get to these werewolves by leaving town on the south road and bearing southeast.<br>
And have you met <font color="LEVEL">Urutu Chief Hatos</font>? If you've reached level 10, he wants to see you. He probably wants to deal with Baranka, the Shaman of Darkness who betrayed us. This is an important matter, so don't waste time. Hatos is in the House of the King, in the center of the village, along with the other chiefs.<br>
If you want more quests, travel around and find them on your own. Make sure to talk to the chiefs in the House of the King.<br>
