Ambitious students of your level should already be familiar with a <font color="LEVEL">Long Sword</font> or an <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Staff</font>. Even if it seems unreachable, you will be able to earn enough to purchase a Long Sword soon.<br>
For armor, start with a <font color="LEVEL">Robe of Devotion and Stockings of Devotion</font>, along with a Buckler, Glove, Leather Shoes and a Wooden Helmet. Having all of these items when reaching level 17 should be considered a success. If you have chosen light armor, you will want the <font color="LEVEL">Bone Breastplate and Bone Gaiters</font>. However, there are many items that have slightly different properties but are available at similar prices, so pay attention to the items being sold and bought by others.<br>
