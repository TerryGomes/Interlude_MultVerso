<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
It's time for you to explore some more of the Kingdom of the Orcs. If you've only hunted around the village, venture out a bit, into the <font color="LEVEL">northeast or the southeast of the kingdom</font>, to see what you may find. Looking at a Map, you can see that our city is located at the west end of the kingdom, so basically you have to head to the east.<br>
The chiefs will have some important quests for you when you reach level 9 or so, but we'll talk more about that later. You'll anger the Prefects if you fail to progress because you're too timid. Explore the kingdom, learn new skills, and practice using them in the wilderness.<br>
I think you're tough enough to finish the jobs those Prefects give you. Have courage!<br>
