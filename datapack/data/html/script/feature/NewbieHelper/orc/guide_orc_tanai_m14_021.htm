Weapons are classified into seven categories. They are: one-handed swords, blunt weapons, two-handed swords and two-handed blunt weapons, daggers, polearms, hand-to-hand combat and bows. I can offer you guidance about swords, blunt weapons, daggers and hand-to-hand combat and I trust you are already fsomewhat familiar with them.<br>
