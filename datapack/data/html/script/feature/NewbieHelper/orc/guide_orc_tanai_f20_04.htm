Look, until you refine your profession, there's nothing more for you to learn. There are no new skills that you can be taught until you choose your professional path at level 20.<br>
I'll give you a piece of advice for when you make the choice. If you decide to be an Orc Raider, you can learn <font color="LEVEL">Stun Attack</font>, to stun opponents with blunt weapons, or <font color="LEVEL">Frenzy</font>, to increase your endurance when your HP is low. If you choose the path of a Monk, you can use <font color="LEVEL">Cripple</font> to disable your foes, or <font color="LEVEL">Bear Soul</font>, which slows you down, but embues you with the attack power of a mighty bear.<br>
Do those sound good to you? Then hurry up and train hard to get to where you can make that choice.<br>
