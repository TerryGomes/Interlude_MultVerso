I suppose you're using the weapons and armor you were issued by the Priests of Pa'agrio. That's unless you have rich friends, of course, eh?<br>
Whatever you have is fine for now. Remember to pay attention to what you find while hunting monsters -- you can find armor, and sometimes even weapons, in the wild. If you're lucky, you might find <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes, Apprentice's Shoes, or a Cloth Cap</font>.<br>
You should have been given two weapons, a Squire's Sword and Training Gloves. Even a novice like you can tell the difference between a sword and a brawling weapon, I think. The <font color="LEVEL">Training Gloves (hand-to-hand weapon)</font> hit twice as often as other weapons, but they're not as powerful. Plus, you need both hands, so forget about a shield. Now the <font color="LEVEL">Squire's Sword (one-handed sword)</font> is much slower than The Gloves, but is more accurate and does more damage. Remember that different weapons may call upon different skills in their use. Either is a worthy weapon -- it is up to you to decide which suits you best.<br>
Come back when you have reached <font color="LEVEL">level 6</font> and we'll talk more about weapons.<br>
