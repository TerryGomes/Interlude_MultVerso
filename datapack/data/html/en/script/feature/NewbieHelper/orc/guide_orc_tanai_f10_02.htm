At level 6, your most important task is to find better weapons. Consider the weapon you are wielding now, then think how you wish to improve.<br>
If you prefer hand-to-hand combat, seek to obtain <font color="LEVEL">Spiked Gloves</font>. Iron Gloves are even better, but will be quite expensive. Spiked Gloves will do. If you prefer the sword, buy a <font color="LEVEL">small sword</font>, or a broadsword if you have the adena to spend. If blunt weapons suit you, you'll do fine with a <font color="LEVEL">club</font>. Blunt weapons have a high accuracy, and those who use them may learn stun skills.<br>
Whatever you choose for close combat, try to get a bow as well, if you can. Bows allow you to draw monsters to you by attacking them from a distance.<br>
Around level 9 or 10 you should have enough adena to purchase better weapons, but you might want to wait awhile, until you've performed a quest for the Chiefs that relates to weapons.<br>
