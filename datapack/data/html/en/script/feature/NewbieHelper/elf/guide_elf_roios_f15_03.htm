For now, let your hunting take second place to quests. Hunt what monsters you may meet during quests like the <font color="LEVEL">"Sea of Spores Fever"</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">"Skirmish with the Orcs"</font>. The Elves who give you these quests will also tell you where to complete them.<br>
If you do have spare time between quests, you might head southeast and across two bridges. You'll find <font color="LEVEL">green dryads</font> there, which will make a suitable quarry at your level. You may not yet be ready to face the Kaboo Orcs who live southwest and across the bridge.<br>
