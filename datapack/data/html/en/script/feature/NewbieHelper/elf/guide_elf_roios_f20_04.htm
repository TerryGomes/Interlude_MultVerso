<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
You have nothing more to learn from the masters of our village. You must refine your professional path at level 20, and seek out new masters in the Human villages of Gludin or Gludio Castle Town - they will teach you new skills.<br>
If you choose the path of the Elven Knight, you may learn skills like Aggression, which aggravates your enemy's desire to attack, or Heavy Armor Mastery, which increases your defense when you wear heavy armor. If you become an Elven Scout, you may learn Bleed, which causes your enemy to bleed profusely, or Bow Mastery, which increases your bow's attack power.<br>
