In order to become an Elven Knight or an Elven Scout, you must be at least <font color="LEVEL">level 20</font>, and you must pass a test.<br>
However, your occupation will not actually change while you are here in the Elven Forest. You must journey out into the Human Kingdom. <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>, which lies south of the forest, is relatively near.<br>
You will receive further counsel from <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Rains</font> of the Fighters Guild in Gludio Castle Town.<br>
