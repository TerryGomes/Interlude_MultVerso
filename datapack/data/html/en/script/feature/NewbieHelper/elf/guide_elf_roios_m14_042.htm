In solo play, you will need to do ever more damage as you advance in level. Therefore, it is important to regularly enhance the power of <font color="LEVEL">Wind Strike</font>, which is your best attack spell.<br>
Defense is just as vital in solo play, so you should also learn <font color="LEVEL">Armor Mastery</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Magic Defense</font>. In an emergency, <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font> is a useful backup. Battle Heal and Heal are of little use during single play combat, since they can't be used while you yourself are under attack, but some skill in the Heal spell is still helpful.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Curse:Weakness</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Wind Shackle</font>, both of which you can learn at level 14, can be quite useful. Wind Shackle will decrease fatigue from movement, and also decrease the risk of offensive spell failure.<br>
