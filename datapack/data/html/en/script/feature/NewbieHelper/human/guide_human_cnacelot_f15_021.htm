Have you considered the next weapon you wish to purchase? A broadsword is just a child's toy to you now. At level 12 or 13 the <font color="LEVEL">Gladius</font> is an excellent choice for a sword, the <font color="LEVEL">dirk</font> for a dagger, and the <font color="LEVEL">Dwarven Mace</font> for a blunt weapon. You can find these weapons in stores, but they are very expensive. You should be able to obtain a much better price by dealing with other adventurers.<br>
I should also point out the <font color="LEVEL">Short Spear</font>, a polearm that is well suited to these levels. Polearms are very slow to wield, but they allow you to attack several enemies at once. However, if you switch from your current weapon type to a polearm now, expect some loss of combat effectiveness until you master the new weapon type.<br>
