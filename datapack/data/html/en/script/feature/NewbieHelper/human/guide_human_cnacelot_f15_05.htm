So which quests are you ready for now? You've grown strong enough that it would be a pity to waste your talents on trivial tasks.<br>
Ah, of course -- <font color="LEVEL">Elias</font>, near here, is worried. I hear that his students at the magic school are suffering from some unknown fever. Perhaps you can be of service to him.<br>
Did you know that <font color="LEVEL">Lilith</font> in the village temple is more than 1,000 years old? When I look at her, I see the traces of painful memories ... perhaps she has a useful task for you?<br>
Oh, and have you been to the north of the island? If you follow the seashore in that direction there's a farm that <font color="LEVEL">Edmond</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Marius</font> run. I told them the place was dangerous, but they built there anyway and now the spiders are giving them grief. But maybe you should wait awhile before heading out that way, I don't think you're quite ready for spiders.<br>
