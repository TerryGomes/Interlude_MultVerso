<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
To refine your profession, you must leave Talking Island for <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font>, the port city of Aden. As a Fighter, the time has come for you to face the dangers of the wide world. If you want to know more about the transition, you must visit the Fighters Guild and speak to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Bitz.</font><br>
When the time comes, you can get to Gludin by taking a ship -- you can buy a ticket at the port. Or you can go to Gatekeeper Roxxy in the village, but that costs a lot more. If you choose to take a boat, you should leave the village through the south gate and follow the seashore to the southeast. When you get to the wharf, buy a ticket from the wharf manager and get on board when a boat arrives. There is a boat every thirty minutes, and they'll make an announcement before it leaves.<br>
