For now, you should hunt <font color="LEVEL">keltirs</font>, <font color="LEVEL">elder keltirs</font>, or <font color="LEVEL">wolves</font> near the village. Wolves are the most dangerous, so take care.<br>
When you target a monster, the monster's name appears in the upper central portion of the screen. <font color="LEVEL">The color of the name tells you the monster's difficulty</font>. For now, hunt those that appear in white or sky blue. Those that appear in red or yellow are much stronger than you, so leave them alone.<br>

Worst of all, they understand teamwork, and if you engage one orc others will come to help it against you. Even if you have a chance against a single orc, two or more will surely slay you.<br>
