Have you encountered <font color="LEVEL">soulshot</font> yet in your adventures? You've heard me use the term before.<br>
It is a form of magical <font color="LEVEL">ammunition</font> created by the Dwarves. You can use soulshot like potions while engaged in armed combat. They allow you to inflict greater damage, but they disappear when used.<br>
Around Level 15 you will be able to acquire weapons that use soulshot. A soulshot rated better than x1 will increase the damage for the number of shots indicated.<br>
