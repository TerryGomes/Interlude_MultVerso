So far, it's likely that you have gotten by mostly with weapons found while adventuring. But now, as you approach level 15, you may find that relying on found weapons is holding you back. To obtain the best weapons for yourself, you should seek out other adventurers willing to trade.<br>
You can buy weapons in stores, of course, but it is usually more economical to trade with other adventurers. They're willing to sell items for less, and purchase your items for more than a merchant would offer.<br>
On the bottom left of the Chat window, click <font color="LEVEL">Trade.</font> You'll probably find the window it opens full of messages from many other adventurers seeking to buy and sell goods. Chat with these adventurers if you want to make a deal. A good sense for dealmaking is an important survival skill.<br>
You should also acquaint yourself with <font color="LEVEL">Private Store</font> on the Action tab.<br>
For the <font color="LEVEL">Sell</font> option, execute the Sell action, then select the item you wish to sell. Set its price and enter a message, then press Start. It sells itself automatically, which comes in very handy.<br>
And for the <font color="LEVEL">Buy</font> option, execute the Buy action, then select the item you wish to buy, its price, and quantity, then press Start. But if you do not currently possess the item you wish to buy, you will not be able to purchase that item. Dwarves may register up to 5 different items on the Buy list, while other races may register up to 4 items.<br>
