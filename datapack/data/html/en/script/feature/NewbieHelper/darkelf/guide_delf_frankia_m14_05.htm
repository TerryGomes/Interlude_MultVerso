Oh, hello! Have you completed your mission for <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Thifiell</font> yet? It is very important that you complete this task.<br>
You should also see <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Karrod</font> located at the western entrance of the village. I heard a rumor that he is recruiting volunteers for an Orc Subjugation quest, which you must complete before you can hunt Orcs.<br>
And, make sure to visit <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Karrod</font>. I suspect he has troubles that need to be dealt with. I'm sure that if you aid him, he'll be most generous.<br>
Look up <font color="LEVEL">Trader Minaless</font> as well. She is looking for a supply of zombie dust, and by dealing with her you can increase the profit from hunting marsh zombies.<br>
