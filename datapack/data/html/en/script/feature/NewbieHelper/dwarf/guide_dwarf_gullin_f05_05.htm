Several of the villagers here could use you to lend them a hand. Talk to them and click on <font color="LEVEL">Quest</font> to see what missions they have to offer.<br>
Of course, even if they're looking for help they're not going to offer you a mission that's beyond your capabilities. If they refuse to offer you anything, it means you need to get some more experience first. Nobody wants the death of a novice on their conscience. Ha!<br>
Oh, and remember -- some quests can only be completed once, but others can be repeated several times.<br>
