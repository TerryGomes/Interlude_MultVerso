<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
Blast me, you've made some progress all right! But so far you haven't had to use your head for much more than a hat stand -- from now on, you'll need to think and plan if you want to survive. In particular, I want you to think about your equipment and skills. I want you to ask me questions now, and remember the answers -- this is very important stuff. And when you reach Level 11, I'll have more information for you.<br>
