Once you achieve a certain level of ability and experience you may advance to a higher class through the class transfer system.<br>
To accomplish a class transfer you must fulfill a <font color="LEVEL">class transfer quest</font>. These quests can be undertaken by characters of level 19 and above. After fulfilling the quest and achieving level 20 or higher, class transfer can be completed. At the time of class transfer you will choose one of many available professions. Once made, your decision is irreversible. Make your choice carefully.<br>
I know all of the teachers in this area for any profession you might choose.<br>
