I advise you now to begin explorations of our own Dark Forest. <font color="LEVEL">If you've only hunted around the village so far, you should begin to venture into the southern regions of the forest</font>.<br>
When you attain Level 10 you must look for <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Thifiell</font>. The Tetrarch may request that you perform an important mission. Until then, continue to practice your spells and skills, for you do not want to shame yourself by returning to the Tetrarch as a failure in your quest.<br>
