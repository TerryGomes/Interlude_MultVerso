<font color="LEVEL">A novice character</font> is one who is new to the world of Lineage II. Certain benefits are available to novice characters up to level 25.<br>
Taxes and other charges have led to a steep increase in prices for armor and weaponry. To help offset this problem, <font color="LEVEL">novice characters can exchange their used gear for full credit towards the purchase of new equipment</font> in any weapon or armor shop.<br1> 
Also, the threat of monsters may be overwhelming for novice characters. I help them as much as possible..<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Come and see me for support magic that is appropriate for your level.</font><br1>
This will help build the confidence you'll need to challenge the powerful monsters in this world.<br1>

Thirdly, <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots and Spiritshot for Novices will be given in addition.</font><br1> 
A novice character can receive additional Soulshots and Spiritshot for novices if he completes a particular quest. The information for this quest will be provided later.<br>
And lastly, occasionally players find that they wish to change the race or class of their character. <font color="LEVEL">Novice character benefits may be passed to a new character up to level 6.</font> However, once a character reaches level 6, then only that character receives benefits as a novice.
