I see. You have chosen a lonely and dangerous path, but it does have its own rewards. If you intend to hunt alone, there are things that you must know.<br>
First you must learn to time your battles wisely. As your level increases, you will find you need more and more rest between battles. Look for ways to decrease the amount of time spent resting.
