<font color="LEVEL">One-handed swords</font> are the most common weapons. Their abilities are well balanced in every way. The Squire's Sword you began your adventures with was one of these. If you are unsure which weapon would be best for you, a one-handed sword is always a suitable choice.<br>
You may use the <font color="LEVEL">Power Strike</font> skill with one-handed swords. As you know, this will substantially increase your damage. A basic tactic for those who use the one-handed sword is to lead with a Power Strike, and immediately follow with a slash. If the target is near death, finish with another Power Strike to gain additional experience with a critical strike.<br>
