Allow me to point out some of the tactical applications of your skills.<br>
If a monster is casting a spell, you have a better chance of disrupting the spell the more damage you inflict. Therefore, damage-increasing skills like Power Strike or Mortal Blow give you a much better chance to cancel a spell. Of course, you may be relieved to know that the only magic-using monsters here in our blessed Elven Forest are the evil Plague Zombies.<br>
Also, be aware of the <font color="LEVEL">critical strike</font> ability which is gained from Power Strike and Power Shot. A critical strike occurs when any of these two skills is used for the final blow against a monster. The experience you gain from a monster can be increased by increasing the amount of damage you inflict with the final blow, so you may increase your experience reward by <font color="LEVEL">using one of these skills when the enemy's HP is near zero</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Elemental Heal</font>, learned at Level 15, is a very useful magic skill. By all means learn it at the earliest opportunity.<br>
