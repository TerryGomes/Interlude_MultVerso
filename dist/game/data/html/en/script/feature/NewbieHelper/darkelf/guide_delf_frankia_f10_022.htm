<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
If you have been fortunate in your adventures, you should be able to improve your armor. You should consider saving your money to upgrade your armor piece by piece. If you've reached Level 6, you can wear Apprentice's Shoes, Cloth Caps and Short Gloves with your armor.<br>
If you are particularly lucky, you may acquire a full set of leather armor. Your masters will advise you to buy both weapons and armor; my advice is to concentrate on improving your armor first, and saving up for better weapons later.<br>
Finally, there is the matter of shields. It is not always wisest to carry a shield into battle. A shield can reduce damage, but it also lowers your evasion. If you are seeking to become a Palus Knight, a shield will work well with your heavy armor, but for an Assassin, wielding daggers and light armor, a shield will only hinder you.<br>
