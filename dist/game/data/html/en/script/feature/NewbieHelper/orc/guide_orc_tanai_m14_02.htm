When you've reached level 8, the most important thing is to acquire weapons. Consider the weapon you are wielding now, then think how you wish to improve it.<br>
If you prefer spellcasting, buy an <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Spellbook.</font> If you like armed combat better, buy a <font color="LEVEL">broadsword or mace.</font><br>
At level 12, you should have enough money to purchase better weapons, but you might want to wait awhile, until you've prerformed a quest for the Chiefs. The quests often relate to weapons.<br>
