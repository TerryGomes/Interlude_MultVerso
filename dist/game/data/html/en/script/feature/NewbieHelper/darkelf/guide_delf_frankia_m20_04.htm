<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
There are no more spells to be learned from the teachers of our village. When you have reached Level 20 and selected your profession, seek out the Human Magisters in that race's village of Gludin and the town of Gludio to learn new spells.<br>
If you become a Dark Wizard, you may be able to Summon Shadow, or cast potent spells like Flame Strike, which inflicts a devastating blast of fire. A Shillien Oracle, on the other hand, might learn Wind Walk, which enhances movement, or powerful healing spells, or the Dryad Root spell, which binds an enemy so it cannot move.<br>
