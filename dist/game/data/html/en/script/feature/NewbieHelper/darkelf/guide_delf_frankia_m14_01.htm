Now it is time to leave behind the village and its immediate surroundings, and explore the deep regions of the Dark Forest.<br>
Remember to visit Tetrarch Thifiell when you reach Level 10, and Blacksmith Karrod at Level 11. The quests they will assign you are of great importance to your development.<br>
