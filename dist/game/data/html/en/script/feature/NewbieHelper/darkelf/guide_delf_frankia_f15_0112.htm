It requires serious preparation to be an effective member of a group. Experience is the best teacher, but I can tell you some of the basics.<br>

Second, when you look at your party in the compass, or <font color="LEVEL">radar</font>, on the top right of the screen, notice that your party members will be marked with <font color="LEVEL">green dots</font>. Also, at the left side of your screen, <font color="LEVEL">you may double-click the Party window to move towards a nearby member.</font> <font color="LEVEL">By double-clicking one of your party members, you will automatically follow the one you have chosen.</font><br>
Monsters usually concentrate their attacks on the person who has injured them the most. Therefore, if you are in a party with another Fighter, try to trade off dealing the majority of the damage, so the monster divides its attacks between the two of you and nobody has to take all the damage. The best way to do this, of course, is to <font color="LEVEL">take turns attacking the monster in close combat.</font><br>
