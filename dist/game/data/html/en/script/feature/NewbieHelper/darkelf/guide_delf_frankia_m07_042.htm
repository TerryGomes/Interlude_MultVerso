You may begin to learn spells at Level 7. I recommend that you begin by learning the <font color="LEVEL">Wind Strike</font> spell to Level 2. If you have enough SP (skill points), you should raise it all the way to Level 3.<br>
If Wind Strike doesn't suit you for some reason, consider a Level 1 <font color="LEVEL">Ice Bolt</font>. This spell will slow the movement rate of your target, and can be a great aid to successful hunting.<br>
