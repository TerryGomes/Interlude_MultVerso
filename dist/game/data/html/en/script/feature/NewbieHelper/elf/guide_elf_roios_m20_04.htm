<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
You have nothing more to learn from the teachers of our village. You must refine your professional path at Level 20, and seek out new mentors in the Human village of Gludin or the town of Gludio -- they will teach you new skills.<br>If you choose the path of an Elven Wizard, you may learn spells like Flame Strike, which blasts your enemies with fierce fire. If you become an Oracle, you may learn Wind Walk, which greatly increases your speed, or Dryad Root, which prevents your enemy from moving, or powerful spells of healing.<br>
