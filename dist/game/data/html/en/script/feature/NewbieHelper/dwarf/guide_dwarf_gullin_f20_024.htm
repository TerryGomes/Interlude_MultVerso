As a Dwarf, you must know that our race has the power to crystallize certain substances into Leaguam, Ravi, Ciel and Arch, through a process we call the "Crystallization Ritual." Our craftsmen have assigned <font color="LEVEL">grades</font> to every substance in the world, according to the types of crystal they form during the ritual.<br>
I'm pretty sure that the items you now use cannot be crystallized -- they're what we call "no grade." However, sabers or assassin knives, which may be acquired beginning at Level 20, are valued at "D grade," for example.<br>
The grades range up to A grade, and I've heard some of the most famous Artisans speak of an "S grade," which surpasses all others. To determine the grade of an item in your inventory, simply click on it in the Inventory window, and the information will be displayed. An icon next to the item's name will tell you the grade.<br>
But remember, an item will not necessarily enhance your performance just because it's graded. Such items cannot be mastered by just anybody. At your level, even a D grade would be difficult to handle. <font color="LEVEL">You must be at least Level 20 to master D grade equipment.</font> If you try to use the equipment at a lower level, you will not gain all the abilities it is capable of, and your speed or your hit rate will usually suffer dramatically as well.<br>
