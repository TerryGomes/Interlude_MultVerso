I am pleased to tell you what I know, but I do not know everything. You should speak to as many of the villagers as you can.<br>
Have you already spoken to <font color="LEVEL">Abyssal Celebrant Undrias</font> at the gate of the Temple of Shilen? He may want to ask a favor of you.<br>
Also, seek out <font color="LEVEL">Sentry Nelsya</font> at the north entrance of the village. 'Tis the season of Shilen's Hunting Ceremony, and they are looking for volunteers.<br>
Let's see ... ah, yes! See that you speak to <font color="LEVEL">Carlon</font> and to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Payne</font> as well.<br>
