It's true that Dwarves don't have the attack skills that some folk do, and there'll be times that you regret that fact. But I'm here to tell you that skills like <font color="LEVEL">Spoil</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Search</font>, that you can pick up at Level 10, are more useful than some of those attack skills that the other races are so proud of. I'll tell you more about them when you reach Level 11, but just keep in mind that there's more to our race than winning brawls.<br>
For right now, you should learn the Armor Mastery and Weapon Mastery skills first. Once you have them and you feel your defenses are in order, learn the <font color="LEVEL">Create Item</font> skill.<br>
