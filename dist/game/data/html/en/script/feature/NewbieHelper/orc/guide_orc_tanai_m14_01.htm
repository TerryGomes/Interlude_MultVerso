<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
It's time for you to explore more of the Kingdom of the Orcs. If you've only hunted around the village, it's time to venture out a bit, into the <font color="LEVEL">northeast or the southeast of the kingdom</font>, to see what you find. Look at a Map, and you'll see that our city is located at the western end of the kingdom, so basically you have to head to the east.<br>
The chiefs will have some important quests for you when you reach level 10 or so, but we can talk more about that later.<br>
And you must decide soon whether you prefer to hunt alone, or as part of a group. Which will it be?<br>
