<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
In party play, Fighters have the job of standing face to face with the enemy. You can hurl attack spells, but it is equally important for you to support the Fighters with healing and strengthening spells.<br>
To effectively support Fighters in combat, make sure you have <font color="LEVEL">Heal</font> to at least level 2, and then enhance <font color="LEVEL">Might</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Shield</font>. Until you reach level 14, use <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font> to strengthen magic power. <font color="LEVEL">Heal</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Battle Heal</font> are much more important than offensive power in party combat.<br>
If you wish to use attack magic, you must continue to develop your Wind Strike spell even after level 14. But remember that party combat only works as long as your Fighters are able to stand up to the enemy, so I advise you not to neglect Heal, Might and Shield.<br>
