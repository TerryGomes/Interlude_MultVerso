Dwarven craftsmen are said to be able to crystallize anything into Leaguam, Ravi, Ciel, or Arch through a process known as the 'Crystallization Ritual'. These Craftsmen have given <font color="LEVEL">grades</font> to every material in the world, by the types of crystal they form during this ritual.<br>
I am fairly certain that the items you have used until now cannot be crystallized. They are called No Grade. Gear that you will acquire around level 20, such as Sabers and Assassin Knives, are designated D Grade.<br>
These grades go up to Grade A, however the highest value equipment is rated Grade S.<br>
To check your item's grade, simply click on the item from the Inventory window. Grade is indicated the icon next to the item's name.<br>
Much skill is required to successfully use high grade equipment. At your present level, even a Grade D may be difficult to handle. <font color="LEVEL">You must be over level 20 to handle Grade D equipment.</font> You will not receive a benefit from using Grade D equipment while you are at a lower level, in fact, it will most likely dramatically reduce your speed and accuracy.<br>
