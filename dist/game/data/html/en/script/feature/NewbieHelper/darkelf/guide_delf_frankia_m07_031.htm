When you target a monster, the monster's name appears in the upper central portion of the screen. <font color="LEVEL">The color of the name tells you the monster's difficulty.</font> Those that appear in white or sky blue have abilities equal or less than yours, while those that appear in red or yellow are stronger than you. Up until Level 4 a Dark Mystic can defeat most yellow monsters. After that level, stick to blue or white prey.<br>
