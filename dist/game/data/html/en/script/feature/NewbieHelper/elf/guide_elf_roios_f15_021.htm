Have you considered the next weapon you wish to purchase? Broadswords are mere children's toys to you now. At Level 12 or 13 the <font color="LEVEL">Gladius</font> is an excellent choice for a sword, the <font color="LEVEL">dirk</font> for a dagger, or the <font color="LEVEL">Dwarven Mace</font> for a blunt weapon. You can find these weapons in stores, but they are very expensive. You should be able to obtain a much better price by dealing with other adventurers.<br>
