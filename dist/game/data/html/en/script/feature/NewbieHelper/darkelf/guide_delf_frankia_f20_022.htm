<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
Upper and lower body armor is classified as either <font color="LEVEL">robes</font>, <font color="LEVEL">light gear</font> or <font color="LEVEL">heavy gear</font>. Robes are for Mystics and that ilk, so we'll skip them and move directly to light and heavy gear.<br>
When you select your occupation at Level 20, the armor you wear will influence your choice of skills. For example, the Palus Knight's Heavy Armor Mastery is a skill which increases defense only when heavy gear is worn. Likewise, the Assassin's Light Armor Mastery increases evasion only when wearing light gear.<br>
Keep in mind, you are only considered to be equipped with a given type of armor if <font color="LEVEL">both the upper and lower body are equipped with the same armor type</font>. Heavy Armor Mastery, for example, will not activate if you are equipped with, say, a Bronze Breastplate and Leather Pants.<br>
These skills are only affected by your upper and lower body armor. Your helmet, gloves and other gear do not signify, so wear what you wish.<br>
