<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
There are plenty of folk here in the village who could use your help. Talk to them and they might offer you an assignment when you click on <font color="LEVEL">Quest</font>. I will tell you of all the quests I know of for Mystics of your level, but there may be others that I have not heard of. Speak to the other villagers to discover their needs.<br>
I can tell you that there are one-time quests that you may only complete once, but also repetitive quests that may be undertaken several times.<br>
