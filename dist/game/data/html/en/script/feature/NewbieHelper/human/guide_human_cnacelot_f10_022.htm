If you've accomplished all that Lector's asked of you, you should be doing well for armor. Nonetheless, you may wish to save your adena to upgrade your armor piece by piece. If you've reached level 6, you can wear Apprentice's Shoes, Cloth Caps and Short Gloves with your armor.<br>
If you are particularly lucky, you may acquire a full set of leather armor.<br>
Your masters will advise you to buy both weapons and armor; my advice is to concentrate on improving your armor first, and saving up for better weapons later.<br>
Finally, there is the matter of shields. It is not always wisest to carry a shield into battle. A shield can reduce damage, but it also lowers your evasive abilities. If you are seeking to become a Knight, a shield will work well with your heavy armor, but for a Rogue, using daggers and light armor, a shield will only hinder you.<br>
