<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
You must refine your profession at level 20. If you don't, there is nothing more that you can be taught. Only after you select your professional path can you go on to learn new skills.<br>
I can tell you that as an Artisan, you can summon golems and learn item-producing skills. As a Scavenger, if that's your preferred path, you'll learn item-collecting skills.<br>
I know you want to learn to be more than you are right now, so hurry up, work harder and get ready for your next step upward.<br>
