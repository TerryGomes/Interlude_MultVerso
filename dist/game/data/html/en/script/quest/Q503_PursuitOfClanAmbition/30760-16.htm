<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
Much has transpired since then. Dire warnings of global destruction and chaos are rife throughout the land. A force has been dispatched to deal with Antharas, and evil spirits are wreaking havoc in several parts of the kingdom. Warlords are battling against each other for the privilege of ruling the territories. We haven't much time. We must quickly conclude our preparations. Have you heard of the <font color="LEVEL">Scepter of Judgment</font>? It is said that he who holds it is invincible in battle. Of course this is nonsense, but the problem is that everyone believes it to be true, from commoner to soldier...<br>
Take this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Sir Eric Rodemai in Aden Castle Town</font>. He and his family are all my faithful servants. You should trust him and offer him your services willingly. He will tell you more when you see him. Now, I pray for the gods' divine protection over you and your clan.
